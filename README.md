# HELP! I'm being framed!

HELP! I'm being framed! (or Framed, for short) is a
[Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) mod for the
[Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/) mod loader.
There are no plans for a version for the Forge mod loader.

Framed adds several types of frames with various shapes. Each
frame can have its texture changed to that of any full-size block in
the game.

[![Requires Fabric API](assets/fabric_api_banner.png)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)

To use Framed, you must install [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).

Starting with version 1.1, you can also install [Conrad](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/conrad)
to configure certain parts of Framed.
